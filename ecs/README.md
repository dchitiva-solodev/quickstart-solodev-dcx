## Solodev DCX Enterprise Edition for Docker

Solodev is the Digital Customer Experience Platform for AWS. Built from the ground up to leverage the power and scalability of AWS services, Solodev is a cloud first enterprise content management system (CMS) and customer experience platform that lets individuals and teams collaborate on their digital transformation.
